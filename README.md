# EarthOrbitPlan : Facilitating Statistical Analysis and Scheduling of Multimessenger Follow-up for GW Events


A Tool for GW Multi-messenger Follow-up and Observational Impact Analysis EarthOrbitPlan is a pipeline designed to support the follow-up of gravitational wave (GW) events using multiple observatories, both ground-based and in orbit. The tool utilizes M4OPT to determine the optimal sky regions accessible to each telescope (Field of Regard, FoR), calculate the required exposure time to achieve the desired signal-to-noise ratio, and identify the most probable sky coordinates for observation.  The pipeline automates key processes, including event processing, filtering, statistical analysis, and visualization of observational data. It simulates different follow-up scenarios for Binary Neutron Star (BNS), Neutron Star-Black Hole (NSBH), and Binary Black Hole (BBH) events, enabling researchers to evaluate the impact of various telescopes on multimessenger observation campaigns.  This approach provides a robust framework for optimizing observation strategies and enhancing the scientific return of GW multimessenger follow-up efforts.
